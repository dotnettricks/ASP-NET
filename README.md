### ASP.NET Asynchronous file upload using jquery
In ASP.NET Ajax, we have AsyncFileUpload control for uploading files asynchronously. If you are using JQuery within your Asp.net application, then using Microsoft Ajax AsyncFileUpload control is not a good practice to upload files asynchronously. Form Last couples of days I was trying to upload and delete files asynchronously using JQuery in Asp.Net and finally I was able to upload and delete files asynchronously. Here I am sharing my asynchronous file upload code. For getting file size before upload refer the article Get file size before upload using jquery.
